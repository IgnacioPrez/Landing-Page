                    of what your words and behavior comunicate to our guests. Always be aware of your posture, remember
                    to stand up straight, your costumers and your back will thank you for it. Put effort into your
                    appearence, all employes are required to dress appropiately, keep your uniform clean and pressed. If
                    you want respect you must look respectable. Speak in complete sentences we never use one word
                    greetings like hey or yeah, always make eye contact and finally whether you're with a customer or not
                    remain composed inside. You can be thinking about your homework or your friends or your side
                    business but no one should ever know it, because at "los pollos hermanos" someone is always watching.
                    So don't forget to smile</p>
